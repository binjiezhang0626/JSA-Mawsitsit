## The Frontend

 Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies. 
### Environment Variables Setup
 - You need a `.env` file to store the environment variables.
 - You need  `import { ... } from 'react-native-dotenv'` to  import the environment variables, then you can use the variables directly.
 -  Please check the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv) if you have any question.
## The Backend
---
Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies. 
- The backend of this project is implemented by `Express`.
- Use `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the sever. 
- You need to config your own environment variables, e.g. `PORT`.
